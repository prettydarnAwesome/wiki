The concept is that [cesque](/cesque) and [zonalhaz](/zonalhaz) are travelling southwards together from the very northernmost part of the UK in flight sim. Our goal is to reach the south of the UK and then onwards from there to... Norway? France? who knows...

# 2020-08-31: Sumburgh `EGPB` â†’ Kirkwall `EGPA`

our first flight! autopilot was being suicidal for both of us so we just navigated manually. also my first time using a 172! - `cesque`
