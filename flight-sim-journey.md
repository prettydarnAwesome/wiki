The concept is that [cesque](/cesque) and [zonalhaz](/zonalhaz) are travelling southwards together from the very northernmost part of the UK in flight sim. Our goal is to reach the south of the UK and then onwards from there to... Norway? France? who knows...

# 2020-08-31: Sumburgh `EGPB` → Kirkwall `EGPA` (57m44s)

our first flight! autopilot was being suicidal for both of us so we just navigated manually. also my first time using a 172! - `cesque`

# 2020-09-02: Kirkwall `EGPA` → Inverness `EGPE` (1h47m33s)

had some autopilot issues again but we both managed to use autopilot for at least some of the flight? according to huw letting autopilot sort itself out works but i'd rather not have my plane be upside down at any point in the flight. a cloudy start (the 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙮 𝙫𝙤𝙞𝙙) but as the sun set towards the end of the flight and we headed west from  Lossiemouth (TACAN: `LSM`) to Inverness, the Scottish coast looked really nice! - `cesque`
