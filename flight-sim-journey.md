The concept is that [cesque](/cesque) and [zonalhaz](/zonalhaz) are travelling southwards together from the very northernmost part of the UK in flight sim. Our goal is to reach the south of the UK and then onwards from there to... Norway? France? who knows...

# 2020-08-31: Sumburgh `EGPB` → Kirkwall `EGPA` (57m44s)

our first flight! autopilot was being suicidal for both of us so we just navigated manually. also my first time using a 172! - `cesque`

# 2020-09-02: Kirkwall `EGPA` → Inverness `EGPE` (1h47m33s)

had some autopilot issues again but we both managed to use autopilot for at least some of the flight? according to huw letting autopilot sort itself out works but i'd rather not have my plane be upside down at any point in the flight. a cloudy start (the 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙮 𝙫𝙤𝙞𝙙) but as the sun set towards the end of the flight and we headed west from  Lossiemouth (TACAN: `LSM`) to Inverness, the Scottish coast looked really nice! also, this is my longest flight i've ever done :O we did active pause so i could go eat in the middle of it, so i'm not sure if that affects the timing, but it's still longer

# 2020-09-05: Inverness `EGPE` → Fort Augustus Airstrip `-` (27m29s)

we took off from Inverness in the small hours of the morning for our short jaunt over Loch Ness. all in all a pleasant, uneventful flight other than an impromptu aileron roll from yours truly when cesque said he could see me. we both landed well on the tiny grass airstrip - `zonalhaz`

we saw lots of wind turbines! but thankfully the wind was very calm. also i was very scared when huw did his aileron roll... i was convinced his plane had disconnected or shut off or something. dude literally dropped out my view out the back window like a freakin rock. fort augustus is a community-made custom airstrip, but there's really not much to it. the stick fences were a nice touch though - `cesque`

# 2020-09-05: Fort Augustus Airstrip `-` → Oban `EGEO` → Islay `EGPI` (1hr11m13s)
