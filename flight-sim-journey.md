The concept is that [cesque](/cesque) and [zonalhaz](/zonalhaz) are travelling southwards together from the very northernmost part of the UK in flight sim. Our goal is to reach the south of the UK and then onwards from there to... Norway? France? who knows...

# 2020-08-31: Sumburgh `EGPB` ‚Üí Kirkwall `EGPA` (57m)

our first flight! autopilot was being suicidal for both of us so we just navigated manually. also my first time using a 172! - `cesque`

# 2020-09-02: Kirkwall `EGPA` ‚Üí Inverness `EGPE` (1h47m)

had some autopilot issues again but we both managed to use autopilot for at least some of the flight? according to huw letting autopilot sort itself out works but i'd rather not have my plane be upside down at any point in the flight. a cloudy start (the ùôúùôßùôñùôÆ ùô´ùô§ùôûùôô) but as the sun set towards the end of the flight and we headed west from  Lossiemouth (TACAN: `LSM`) to Inverness, the Scottish coast looked really nice! also, this is my longest flight i've ever done :O we did active pause so i could go eat in the middle of it, so i'm not sure if that affects the timing, but it's still longer

# 2020-09-05: Inverness `EGPE` ‚Üí Fort Augustus Airstrip `-` (27m)

we took off from Inverness in the small hours of the morning for our short jaunt over Loch Ness. all in all a pleasant, uneventful flight other than an impromptu aileron roll from yours truly when cesque said he could see me. we both landed well on the tiny grass airstrip - `zonalhaz`

</a>

we saw lots of wind turbines! but thankfully the wind was very calm. also i was very scared when huw did his aileron roll... i was convinced his plane had disconnected or shut off or something. dude literally dropped out my view out the back window like a freakin rock. fort augustus is a community-made custom airstrip, but there's really not much to it. the stick fences were a nice touch though - `cesque`

# 2020-09-05: Fort Augustus Airstrip `-` ‚Üí Oban `EGEO` ‚Üí Islay `EGPI` (1hr11m)

we landed at Oban and decided we wanted to keep going and so headed to the island of Islay (apparently `/Ààa…™l…ô/` which is cursed). there were some really spectacular sights in this journey as we headed out over Loch Linnhe and the Firth of Lorn. also we managed to do a good job of using our autopilots and cruising really smoothly and mostly safely (though we were very close together at certain points which is definitely not safe).

then i crashed my wing tip into a building at Islay airport. - `cesque`

# 2020-09-05: Islay `EGPI` ‚Üí Aldergrove, Belfast `EGAA` (29m)

we finally reached mainland Ireland! we used approach mode to basically do almost the entire landing automatically, though it seemed to get a bit sketchy very close to the runway and required manual landing in both our cases. also we had to taxi across the universe. - `cesque`

# 2020-09-05: Aldergrove, Belfast `EGAA` ‚Üí Valley `EGOV` (via Dublin Intl. `EIDW`) (55m)

chill little flight with passengers! we went south to Dublin then east over to Valley, joining the localiser for a pretty easy landing. speaking of, turns out the localiser here is offset? we thought it was a bug, but... nah it's on the charts and we just missed it lol - `cesque`

# 2020-09-27: Valley `EGOV` ‚Üí Haverfordwest `EGFE` (1h43m)

took a seaplane and landed in the sea at Grassholm (i almost crashed into it because i was watching tom play PoE), then took off again on a short jaunt to Haverfordwest - `cesque`

# 2020-10-03: Haverfordwest `EGFE` ‚Üí Cardiff `EGFF` ‚Üí Cosford `EGWC` (1h46m)

live weather = extremely difficult landing in Cosford. i'm ashamed to say that i drove off the runway and directly into a field :flushed:

# 2020-10-10 Cosford `EGWC` ‚Üí Birmingham `EGBB` (30m)

we did a VFR jaunt in the 152... it's been a while since i flew this! was super cool to see the custom B'ham scenery, we did a few loops around Aston and the city centre to see everything :D

# 2020-10-10 Birmingham `EGBB` ‚Üí Heathrow `EGLL` (30m)

i put this one in a separate entry because we switched planes. me and huw are doctors and we're transporting a full circulatory system in a 208 Grand Caravan because someone in a Heathrow lounge is missing theirs. we actually used SimBrief to generate a plan for this one, which was cool. very chill, autopilot did everything, which was a nice change after flying the 152 again lmao
