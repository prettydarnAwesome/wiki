The concept is that [cesque](/cesque) and [zonalhaz](/zonalhaz) are travelling southwards together from the very northernmost part of the UK in flight sim. Our goal is to reach the south of the UK and then onwards from there to... Norway? France? who knows...

# 2020-08-31: Sumburgh `EGPB` ‚Üí Kirkwall `EGPA` (57m)

our first flight! autopilot was being suicidal for both of us so we just navigated manually. also my first time using a 172! - `cesque`

# 2020-09-02: Kirkwall `EGPA` ‚Üí Inverness `EGPE` (1h47m)

had some autopilot issues again but we both managed to use autopilot for at least some of the flight? according to huw letting autopilot sort itself out works but i'd rather not have my plane be upside down at any point in the flight. a cloudy start (the ùôúùôßùôñùôÆ ùô´ùô§ùôûùôô) but as the sun set towards the end of the flight and we headed west from  Lossiemouth (TACAN: `LSM`) to Inverness, the Scottish coast looked really nice! also, this is my longest flight i've ever done :O we did active pause so i could go eat in the middle of it, so i'm not sure if that affects the timing, but it's still longer

# 2020-09-05: Inverness `EGPE` ‚Üí Fort Augustus Airstrip `-` (27m)

we took off from Inverness in the small hours of the morning for our short jaunt over Loch Ness. all in all a pleasant, uneventful flight other than an impromptu aileron roll from yours truly when cesque said he could see me. we both landed well on the tiny grass airstrip - `zonalhaz`

</a>

we saw lots of wind turbines! but thankfully the wind was very calm. also i was very scared when huw did his aileron roll... i was convinced his plane had disconnected or shut off or something. dude literally dropped out my view out the back window like a freakin rock. fort augustus is a community-made custom airstrip, but there's really not much to it. the stick fences were a nice touch though - `cesque`

# 2020-09-05: Fort Augustus Airstrip `-` ‚Üí Oban `EGEO` ‚Üí Islay `EGPI` (1hr11m)

we landed at Oban and decided we wanted to keep going and so headed to the island of Islay (apparently `/Ààa…™l…ô/` which is cursed). there were some really spectacular sights in this journey as we headed out over Loch Linnhe and the Firth of Lorn. also we managed to do a good job of using our autopilots and cruising really smoothly and mostly safely (though we were very close together at certain points which is definitely not safe).

then i crashed my wing tip into a building at Islay airport. - `cesque`

# 2020-09-05: Islay `EGPI` ‚Üí Aldergrove, Belfast `EGAA` (29m)

we finally reached mainland Ireland! we used approach mode to basically do almost the entire landing automatically, though it seemed to get a bit sketchy very close to the runway and required manual landing in both our cases. also we had to taxi across the universe. - `cesque`

</a>

# 2020-09-05: Aldergrove, Belfast `EGAA` ‚Üí Valley `EGOV` (via Dublin Intl. `EIDW`) (55m)

chill little flight with passengers! we went south to Dublin then east over to Valley, joining the localiser for a pretty easy landing. speaking of, turns out the localiser here is offset? we thought it was a bug, but... nah it's on the charts and we just missed it lol - `cesque`

# 2020-09-27: Valley `EGOV` ‚Üí Haverfordwest `EGFE` (1h43m)

took a seaplane and landed in the sea at Grassholm (i almost crashed into it because i was watching tom play PoE), then took off again on a short jaunt to Haverfordwest - `cesque`

# 2020-10-03: Haverfordwest `EGFE` ‚Üí Cardiff `EGFF` ‚Üí Cosford `EGWC` (1h46m)

live weather = extremely difficult landing in Cosford. i'm ashamed to say that i drove off the runway and directly into a field :flushed: - `cesque`

# 2020-10-10 Cosford `EGWC` ‚Üí Birmingham `EGBB` (30m)

we did a VFR jaunt in the 152... it's been a while since i flew this! was super cool to see the custom B'ham scenery, we did a few loops around Aston and the city centre to see everything :D - `cesque`

# 2020-10-10 Birmingham `EGBB` ‚Üí Heathrow `EGLL` (30m)

i put this one in a separate entry because we switched planes. me and huw are doctors and we're transporting a full circulatory system in a 208 Grand Caravan because someone in a Heathrow lounge is missing theirs. we actually used SimBrief to generate a plan for this one, which was cool. very chill, autopilot did everything, which was a nice change after flying the 152 again lmao - `cesque`

# 2020-10-10 Heathrow `EGLL` ‚Üí Amsterdam `EHAM` (1h00m)

our first flight in the Citation CJ4! it was very... eventful, but also uneventful as well. huw's takeoff was cursed because the plane just wanted to go down shortly after it had gone up. then we both got onto the actual flight plan and everything was A-OK. huw made it to Amsterdam in good time, but the autopilot seemed intent on finishing the job that it had started earlier, and caused him to crash in front of the runway. as for me: for some reason i found myself heading basically in the opposite direction to where i wanted after a botched approach update, and had to spend like 10 mins at least getting back on track. after that i was fine, approach mode was taking me in to land&mdash;**wait, you wanted to land? i thought you wanted to just go over the runway at 2000 feet. my bad!** i ended up circling round without autopilot, coming at the runway at a near enough 45deg angle, and somehow salvaging the whole landing out of nowhere (inasmuch as you can call it a landing). then we got to do the infamous 18R taxi :D - `cesque`

# 2020-10-21 Amsterdam `EHAM` ‚Üí Amsterdam `EHAM` (42m) (BONUS!)

we tried landing at AMS again since huw crashed last time. huw's flight seemed fine. mine was hell very bad awful everything was broken - `cesque`

# 2020-10-23 Amsterdam `EHAM` ‚Üí Hamburg `EDDH` (1h31m)

huw active paused so his AP was borked for the latter part of the flight and he had to land by hand. he still landed better than i did because i forgot to lower the landing gear and S C R A P E D my way along the runway :flushed: - `cesque`

# 2020-10-23 Hamburg `EDDH` ‚Üí Bergen Flesland `ENBR` (1h27m)

why do i keep forgetting to lower the landing gear :( - `cesque`

# 2020-10-23 Bergen Flesland `ENBR` ‚Üí [√Ölesund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRoMueB3S7A) Vigra `ENAL` (36m)

our first time flying the Daher TBM. i somehow managed to crash the entire sim again? it's always when i'm messing with the flightplan rofl - `cesque`

# 2020-10-23 Bergen Flesland `ENAL` ‚Üí Ostersund `ESNZ` (54m)

over to Sweden during the night! ATC gave us visual landings which we were not really prepared for; i landed like 2m in front of the runway. maybe i need to throttle up more while i have full flaps... - `cesque`

# 2020-10-30 Ostersund `ESNZ` ‚Üí Sundsvall-Timra `ESNN` (50m)

an all-round successful flight in the 152 (baby plane), mostly navigating via NDB - `cesque`


# 2020-11-04 Sundsvall-Timra `ESNN` ‚Üí Vaasa `EFVA` (30m)

a pretty calm flight for me, though cesque had some autopilot issues that took him off course for a while. i  like the Daher TBM  - `zonalhaz`

# 2020-11-06 Vaasa `EFVA` ‚Üí Arlanda `ESSA` (1h07m)

back to Sweden in the snow, cesque's plane decided to fall out the sky while he went to get pizza and atc ghosted me for landing but other than that it was pretty chill (heheh)  - `zonalhaz`

# 2020-11-08 Arlanda `ESSA` ‚Üí Visby `ESSV` (47m)

we forgot to write this one down D:

# 2020-12-02 Visby `ESSV` ‚Üí Olanda `ESMZ` (28m)

a night flight in the Diamond DA40NG. Olanda is very small and had no runway lights which made finding it slightly awkward but we both landed successfully - `zonalhaz` (yeah i had no idea where the runway was - `cesque`)

# 2020-12-05 Olanda `ESMZ` ‚Üí Tallinn `EETN` (1h35m)
# 2020-12-05 Tallinn `EETN` ‚Üí Riga `EVRA` (50m)

2 good flights, although we got hit with the ATC bug where it sends you back a waypoint when you input an approach. TWICE! our flight paths look horrible :( - `cesque`

# 2020-12-05 Riga `EVRA` ‚Üí Vilnius `EYVI` (38m)
# 2020-12-05 Vilnius `EYVI` ‚Üí Hrodna `UMMG` (33m)
FIRST FLIGHT: huw's approach was kinda scuffed, and mine didn't exactly line up with the runway, so we did pretty well considering. SECOND FLIGHT: to hrodna! or maybe grodno! nice little flight with buttery landings for both of us (albeit on opposite sides of the same runway, i had to roll and then turn around and taxi back, presumably being yelled at to get off the freakin runway while huw was on his short final) - `cesque`

# 2021-01-12 Hrodna `UMMG` ‚Üí Kaliningrad `UMKK` (36m)
lets gooooooooo we played again! my game looks real pretty, and i can fly the Longitude now. was a clean and FAST flight aside from us not knowing how to change CDI source at the start. - `cesque`
# 2021-01-12 Kaliningrad `UMKK` ‚Üí Warsaw Chopin `EPWA` (50m)

# 2021-01-12 Warsaw Chopin `UMKK` ‚Üí Poprad Tatry `LZTT` (1h43m)
nice takeoff! nice flight, relaxing, lots of clouds! watching Jak play PoE! but also... hell approach! changing anything in the flight plan is cursed and breaks everything :( - `cesque`

# 2021-01-12 Poprad Tatry `LZTT` ‚Üí Brno Turany `LKTB` (55m)
someone put a big-ass mountain directly in the way of the start of our flight path. after circling to gain enough height to get past it, the rest of the flight was butter smooth all the way to parking at Brno. also i used my new Saitek Multi Panel! - `cesque`

# 2021-05-16 Brno Turany `LZTT` ‚Üí  Innsbruck `LOWI` (52m)
 not a bad flight considering we didn't play in 4 months. but as always, landing is kinda hell. also me and huw were pretty synced up - `cesque`

# 2021-05-16 Brno Turany `LOWI` ‚Üí Vienna Tessera `LIPZ` (1h21m)
beautiful! i love austrian mountains!!! wow. it was very scary to avoid mountains while flying through the clouds but once we got past that, it was pretty nice and comfy. we followed the river down past some nice towns nestled in the mountains, then out onto the plains and landed at Venice. - `cesque`

# 2021-05-30 Tessera `LIPZ` ‚Üí Ljublana Brnik `LJLJ` (58m)
flew in the Diamond DV20, and i like this plane. lots of visibility, and it has instruments (but no autopilot). pretty comfy - `cesque`


# 2021-07-29 Ljublana Brnik `LJLJ` ‚Üí Krk Island `LDRI` (54m)
dan crashed like twice but got there in the end. i had a pretty smooth flight. - `zonalhaz`

# 2021-08-21 Krk Island `LDRI` ‚Üí Zagreb Pleso (Franjo Tuƒëman) `LDZA` (1h03m)
we used headtracking! which worked pretty well aside from when adding our flight plans. there was a little confusing in the middle; i got sent up to 17,000ft when basically at the airport, and huw got almost sent back to Rijeka, but our actual landings were both smooth as heck. also tracked my flight in Tacview, though unfortunately it didn't track huw's flight too (i think because of an MSFS bug). now we can go visit marvin lets goooooo - `cesque` 

# 2021-08-30 Zagreb Pleso (Franjo Tuƒëman) `LDZA` ‚Üí Heviz-Balaton `LHSM` (37m)
you know what? this was probably one of the most stable flights between the two of us. also we saw Balaton Lake which is apparently a cool holiday destination. looked nice. though huw did call it Piss Lake... - `cesque`
# 2021-08-30 Heviz-Balaton `LHSM` ‚Üí Jelas `LDOR` (44m)
arrived in Slavonski Brod! the airport (okay, air*strip*) is right behind City Colosseum so we are gonna go see a movie and get some mlinar pog. visual landing so we were kiiiinda in hell but we managed it. 

also this is basically our 1 year anniversary flight(s) since our first flight was on 2020-08-31. congrats! üõ´üéâ‚ú® - `cesque`

# 2022-01-15 Jelas `LDOR` ‚Üí Nikola Tesla Belgrade `LHSM`(46m)
hooray, we flew again after 100000 years! out of slavonski brod (i saw the fort) and along the Sava to Belgrade. my first flight on my new ultrawide monitor too - `cesque`

# 2022-01-23 Nikola Tesla Belgrade `LHSM` ‚Üí Sarajevo `LQSA` (1h17m)
using my newly-found VOR navigation knowledge, we did this flight in the 152 without checking our position on maps or anything, just following VORs and also NDB at the end. easy peasy (even if they did put Sarajevo airport in the middle of a bunch of hills) üáßüá¶ - `cesque`
