# Brand Guidelines
Aside from some exceptions which will be shortly mentioned, cesque's username should always be written in all lowercase (e.g. **cesque**). This includes situations where capitals would be more appropriate - for example, starting a sentence:

> ❌ Cesque is good at video games.
> ✅ cesque is bad at video games.
> 
As exceptions to this rule, the capitalised version (**Cesque**) can be used when strict uniformity is required, such as in a list of names of which all others are capitalised (see the [home page](home)). The capitalised version can also be used to differentiate the name from its surrounding text when a reader is likely to find the sentence ambiguous otherwise. Additionally, when a social media username is used to identify cesque, and that username is capitalised, the capitalised version should be used ONLY when sharing the username for purposes of adding cesque as a friend. The most notable example of this is cesque's Battle.net username, which is styled with a capital C; when this username is shared, it should ALWAYS be set apart from other usages of the username by including the Battle.net numeric code after the username, and ideally by not including it in the normal flow of text but rather as an aside:

> ❌ Don't play Overwatch with Cesque - he only plays Zarya and Symmetra and he's bad at both.
> ✅ Add my friend (Cesque#2732) and you will win every single game because he's a god probably.

In addition to the username **cesque**, cesque can also be referred to with the pseudonym **ruff**. For this name, the above rules on capitalisation also apply.

*(this is a joke i'm not really an asshole)*

*(but also use lowercase because uppercase sucks)*
