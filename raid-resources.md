for Collections:
  Leviathan:
    [ ] - emblem: Splish Splash
      Bathing Pools/baths: one player must stay on the center plate at all times.
      apparently you can be anywhere in the water? but no jumping!
    [ ] - emblem: Two Enter, One Leaves
      Gauntlet/: you can't pick up the bomb twice. this is basically the prestige
      mode
    [ ] - emblem: Good Dog
      Pleasure Gardens/dogs: each crystal holder can only shoot 1 flower. so the
      maximum buff you get is x24
    [ ] - emblem: Take the Throne
      Calus: in each damage phase, you need to activate all 4 plates at the same
      time
  Crown of Sorrow:
    [ ] - ghost shell: Shadow of Earth Shell
      Complete each encounter without any player getting the Witch's Curse
      debuff. Don't have to do them in one run!


for Blacksmith:
  [ ] - flawless Scourge of the Past
    there are 6 buttons at the start of the encounter you need to hit in order
    to activate this - recommend assigning each player a button as needed
  [ ] - "Hold the Line" challenge
    first encounter: don't let the energy meter drop below half. look up a good
    strat for this
  [ ] - "All for One, One for All" challenge
    penultimate encounter: each player must dunk one of each symbol. will make
    encounter long, and you don't find out if you failed until you beat it and
    gotta do the raid again
  [ ] - "Each to their Own" challenge
    last encounter: each player must shoot exactly 1 of Insurrection Prime's
    generators. unclear if this needs to be the same generator in 2nd+ phase
  [ ] - "Raider of the Lost Treasure" triumph
    need to get the secret chest in sparrow encounter by hitting the buttons. we
    need to get this chest 5 times in total
  [ ] - "Fast and Unwieldy" triumph
    need to beat the sparrow encounter without anyone dying
