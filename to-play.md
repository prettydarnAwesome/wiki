<!-- TITLE: To Play -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Games which we should get round to playing as a group -->

This is a big list of all multiplayer games we should try to play. This doesn't include singleplayer games which are streamed, which should be put on individual people's pages? I guess?

# The Listâ„¢
* Destiny 2 raid content
* Mysterium
* Dungeon Defenders 2
* Stellaris
* Crusader Kings 2
* Dota 2
* No Man's Sky (when multiplayer update hits)
* Monster Hunter
