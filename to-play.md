<!-- TITLE: To Play -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Games which we should get round to playing as a group -->

This is a big list of all multiplayer games we should try to play. This doesn't include singleplayer games which are streamed, which should be put on individual people's pages? I guess?

# The Listâ„¢
* Destiny 2 raid content
* Mysterium
* Astroneer
* Dungeon Defenders 2 (or the original)
* Stellaris
* Crusader Kings 2
* Dota 2
* Divinity: Original Sin 2
* No Man's Sky (when multiplayer update hits)
* Monster Hunter
* Get people to get the Hunter game
* Keep talking and someone will die of natural causes (also explosions)
* [Raft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/648800/Raft/)
* Titan Quest (Anniversary Edition)
* [Barony](https://store.steampowered.com/app/371970/Barony/) - apparently 4 player co-op is good fun
