# Ideas
**Language RPG game??**
* It's coop like journey (as in you can't choose who to play with).
* You can only communicate through symbols with no intrinsic meaning, so you need to agree upon meaning.
* ??

**Not really a game but**
* Use `git` hooks to require you to answer trivia questions every time you wanna execute a command
* Preferably 'capitals of the world' trivia

**Wild Pictionary**
* pictionary but everyone draws their word at the same time AND guesses simultaneously. while they're drawing. everyone does everything at the same time
* i've no idea how you score this

**[Cesque](Cesque)'s Marble Game**
* cesque knows about this
* let's be real it's basically Marble Drop by maxis
* but with some cool story probably
  
**minimalist fighting game**

* imagine you distil the concept of a fighting game to its bare essentials
* no characters, no moving, just timing your 4 different types of inputs to beat your opponent
