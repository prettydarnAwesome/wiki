The Burger Cube offers you the ability to eat 3 burgers at once. Or maybe 6, if you consider a normal burger to be 2 burgers because you can flip it upside down to get a new, unique burger.

# Additional Information
* It is most likely necessary to ensure structural stability by using long cocktail sticks through each axis of the Burger Cube to hold it together. Alternatively, this could be done using extremely sticky tomato ketchup or burger sauce.
