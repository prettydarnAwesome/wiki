##i thought of an opporator idea hes a defender and they call him step. Step is a 2 speed 2 armour opporator who can temporarily put down a ladder placed simular to tachankas mounted gun which allows them to raise their height for better angles. They can use his ladder to extend up though skyhatches and if you place the gap over a door and an enemy steps though they get bad luck and their gun randomly jams for the rest of the game. If you break the ladder whilst someone is opporating it the ladder injurs the opporator. If it is in opporation whilst someone walk through they get bad luck+ which is an increased rate of jamming
